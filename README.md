This code was written with the aim of analyzing and displaying social networks, focusing on the detection of communities and their visual representation in a network. Using networkx, pyvis, community_louvain, and matplotlib libraries allows the user to analyze a network of nodes and edges and identify communities in the network using the Louvain algorithm. The key features and main steps of this code are as follows:

Reading the GML file: The code first reads a GML file that describes a network of nodes and edges. This is a popular file format for storing network graphs.

Calculating PageRank: Using the PageRank algorithm, the importance of each node in the network is calculated, which is used to determine the size of the nodes in the visual representation.

Implementation of Lovin's algorithm: This algorithm is used to identify communities in the network. Each node is assigned to a community, which makes it possible to analyze the social structure of the network.

Visual display of the network: Using the pyvis library, an interactive display of the network is created, where communities are shown in different colors and the central nodes of each community are identified.

Advanced settings to improve display: The code includes advanced settings to improve the visual display of the network, including adjusting gravity, length and strength of springs, damping, and avoiding node interference.

Color setting for each community: A unique color is chosen for each community so that the difference between communities can be clearly distinguished.

Display central nodes: nodes with the highest page rank
